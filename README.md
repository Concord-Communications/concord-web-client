# Concord chat
The new self hosted instant group messaging solution

> [!NOTE]
> Concord used to be called Termichat, certain database and other features use that as the name. Also **sorry to all good frontend devs. I don't write good UI code ðŸ«¡**

# Quickstart
Run the following to build and start the docker container, this assumes you already have the backend running
```
chmod +x ./docker_setup.sh && ./docker_setup.sh
```
